Attack 11 (Jab 1)
Comes out 2 frames sooner.

Attack 12 and Attack 13 (Jabs 2 and 3)
Both come out one frame sooner.

Dtilt
Comes out 2 frames sooner. (still the slowest Dtilt in the game)

Jump Strike (Side Smash)
Animation modified.
Hitbox damage increased- 3%- 16%.
KB given smash properties.

Second hitbox wasn't working properly. Has been adjusted to send at the Sakurai angle and work as a proper smash attack capable of KOing. Similarly to Link's old Fsmash, the 2nd and 3rd hits of this attack can now both connect on low percent foes to deal high damage if spaced properly. However, the 1st and 3rd cannot.

Fair
Comes out 2 frames sooner

Pivot Grab
Grabbox extended from 7 frames to 8.

Fthrow
Endlag reduced 8 frames. Angle changed from 169- 3C. Base KB increased by 10. (Link's Fthrow has been useless for a very long time. Now it works as a proper ground to air combo starter.)

Bthrow
Now as strong as it used to be prehelm splitter.
Also has been touched up a bit aesthetically.

Ending Blow landing
FSM sped up from 0.5- 0.7

(This move has many bugs where it happens and you get caught in the landlag after a normal aerial or all hits don't connect. This allows you to get free just a little sooner in the case of one of those events. Also, the animation looked plain bad in super slow motion.)

Bomb Pull
FSM slowed from 2- 1.7
Link was able to pull bombs very quickly to the point where they were basically free combo finishers at high percent thanks to Minus's hitstun. With this slight reduction, his opponents will have just a little more time to react.
