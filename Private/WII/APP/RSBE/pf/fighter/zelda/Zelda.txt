Zelda had an issue with her down tilt's hitbox and graphic effect. The move was repurposed to not be as safe and rewarding in the previous update.
 However, it wasn't able to carry out the task of on stage ledge guarding better than her side smash. 
This has resulted in an angle change which launches opponents upward and allows her to follow with aerials and more. 
The hitbox has been moved up slightly to allow onstage hits and complements her kit very well.

B- Nayru's Love
Modified to allow Zelda to move forward or backward while using it while on the ground slightly more distance than her dodge.

Interrupt is 6 frames sooner.
