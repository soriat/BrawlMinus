Ganon Changelog


N-Air:

Despite my best efforts, N-air was still not connecting all the time. So I’ve completely remade it into a new burst attack that causes ganon to stall for a split second in the air. This move is designed to do above average damage for an aerial, but not be as good of a killing option.

It has a 4-frame sweetspot for 25%, and a sourspot for 10%. This move will kill Mario at approx. 115% from the center of FD when sweetspotted. It also has a slight hover during the hitbox’s duration.



Down-B (ground): 

Interrupt moved back 20 frames (frame 21 ——> 40). Startup FSM 2 —-> 0.6. Super Armor reinstated. Horizontal momentum (2.0) added in a quick burst of speed, which is negated 3 frames later.




U-Tilt:

Replaced with a magical uppercut. It multihits and sets up giving Ganon a reliable low percent ground to air attack with good range and low ending lag. Not good for KOing however.


Down Smash:

Replaced with his old Utilt. Ganon is now able to charge his explosive heel drop and release it when he actually needs to. Though it doesn't cover the entire stage anymore. It instead only hits behind him, making for a good surprise on his foes.




Neutral-B:

Original 666% punch, improved with on-hit explosion graphics / laughing sounds, and additional aura graphics on startup.



Holding B will now speed up the move (1.5x) , and cause Ganon to release the Ganonuke.

It’s a Size 75 hitbox that only hits grounded opponents for 10%. Kills at 160%.


Vertical Momentum and FSM added on the end of the move so you won’t die offstage as easily.



Up-B:

(FINALLY) Has added graphics, signifying the hitbox size of the ‘claw’ at the end of the animation.
