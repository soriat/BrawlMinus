Kien's Changes: 

Nair's hitboxes were done horribly wrong. Not only was there never a hitbox on Samus' foot, but what should have been a change hitbox damage command was instead a new group of much smaller hitboxes only covering the middle of her leg. This prevented Samus from using Nair at all to juggle as her foot wouldn't even hit.




Mech’s Changes: 

(REMOVED) N-Air has been turned into a two hit attack, designed to put people into projectile range for a quick follow-up cancel (Specials or Z-Air). (REMOVED)

F-Air has been tweaked so all hitboxes will link much more reliably.

Z-Air crashing has been fixed, attack now hits once for 10, instead of twice for 18. Knockback growth reduced.

U-Air hits more reliably, now sends opponents straight up for combos.

Grab now lingers, identical to ZSS’ grab.

Quick Ledge Attack has had a second hit added on startup to catch smaller foes. Beforehand, you could stand at the edge of the stage, and if you were small enough, Samus would go right over you.

Recovery Boost: More horizontal distance/control.
Air Friction: 0.75 —> 1.35
Horizontal Control: 0.034 —> 0.5

Made Charging possible in air. (doesn’t seem to work, sadly.)
