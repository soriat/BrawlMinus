Changelist

Falcon’s Jab has now been reworked. AAA = no infinite jab , AAZ = infinite jab INSTEAD of the third hit (knee).

Falcon Punch aerial momentum restored. Falcon no longer plummets to his doom when using the move in the air.

Forward momentum added to Ground Punch (0.2), and Aerial Punch (0.1), to help connectivity. Hitlag reverted to MAX 1.0 speed (3,3,3,6)
