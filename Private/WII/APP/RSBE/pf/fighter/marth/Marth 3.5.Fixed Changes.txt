Marth has been given a slight aesthetic makeover. He has lost elemental attributes in Dancing Blade, and his sword glows have been switched around according to the type of attack he deals.

Red= Removed. He gave it to Roy.

Blue= Aerials and Tilts
Green= Smashes
Purple= Specials

Other small Marth changes.
Dancing Blade High no longer freezes, knockback has been adjusted to ensure it KOs at the same percent as before.
