ZSS Changelog



Side Smash
Growth reduced from 7A- 6A. The move now kills 17% later. It was toned down because most of her B moves allow smash followups. Killing in low 80s was uncalled for even with the high startup and endlag, as the range compensates for both.


F-Air: 2x Hitstun if second hit connects. This is a powerful move, and it has been given stun/graphics to illustrate that.



D-Smash: Allow Interrupt removed. This allowed you to get three d-smashes in a row, racking up damage at an obscene rate.



Alternate Jab remapped to Z, for easier use.



Dash Attack: Cancel moved to frame 50. This is to prevent the repeated use of Dash attacks, which chained together near-perfectly, allowing you to push your opponent closer to the blastline.

 Another cancel has been added at frame 20, which allows you to use ground attacks. This cancel is also conditional, requiring the dash attack to have successfully connected first.
